\title{Get / Set measurement levels for declared objects}
\usage{
measurement(x)

measurement(x) <- value
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A declared vector.}

\item{value}{A single character string of measurement levels,
separated by commas.}
}
\value{
A character vector.
}
\description{
Functions to extract information about the measurement levels of a variable
(if already present), or to specify such measurement levels.
}
\details{
This function creates an attribute called \code{"measurement"} to a declared
object. This is an optional feature, at this point for purely aesthetic
reasons, but it might become useful in the future to (automatically)
determine if a declared object is suitable for a certain statistical
analysis, for instance regression requires quantitative variables, while some
declared objects are certainly categorical despite using numbers to denote
categories.

It distinguishes between \code{"categorical"} and \code{"quantitative"} types of
variables, and additionally recognizes \code{"nominal"} and \code{"ordinal"} as
categorical, and similarly recognizes \code{"interval"}, \code{"ratio"},
\code{"discrete"} and \code{"continuous"} as quantitative.

The words \code{"qualitative"} is treated as a synonym for \code{"categorical"},
and the words \code{"metric"} and \code{"numeric"} are treated as synonyms for
\code{"quantitative"}, respectively.

x <- declared(
    c(-2, 1:5, -1),
    labels = c(Good = 1, Bad = 5, DK = -1),
    na_values = c(-1, -2),
    label = "Test variable"

x

measurement(x)

# automatically recognized as categorical
measurement(x) <- "ordinal"

measurement(x)

# the same with
measurement(x) <- "categorical, ordinal"

set.seed(1890)
x <- declared(
    sample(c(18:90, -91), 20, replace = TRUE),
    labels = c("No answer" = -91),
    na_values = -91,
    label = "Respondent's age"
)

# automatically recognized as quantitative
measurement(x) <- "discrete"

measurement(x)

# the same with
measurement(x) <- "metric, discrete"
