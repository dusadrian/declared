\title{Functions for Declared Missing Values}
\description{
A set of functions to declare labels and missing values, coupled
with associated functions to create (weighted) tables of frequencies and
various other summary measures.
Some of the base functions are rewritten to make use of the specific
information about the missing values, most importantly to distinguish between
empty and declared missing values.
Many functions have a similar functionality with the corresponding ones from
packages "haven" and "labelled". The aim is to ensure as much compatibility
as possible with these packages, while offering an alternative in the objects
of class "declared".
